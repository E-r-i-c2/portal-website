To add your image (`public/img/1748744745106-5c0103f3-064b-411e-a639-2a61fe336522.png`) and a description to the news page, the simplest way is to add a new news article section directly in the `public/html/news.html` file, similar to the existing "Test Article".

Would you like to:
- Add the image and description as a new static article (visible to everyone, always)?
- Or, do you want it to be a "local news" article (which would require updating the backend and/or news form to support images)?

For now, I will proceed with the simplest option: adding a new static article to the HTML. Please provide the description text you want to display with the image, or let me know if you want to use a placeholder.
